Using them as variable names would lead to syntax errors because the compiler or interpreter would interpret them as commands or instructions rather than variables.\n","\n","5.What is mutability in Python?\n","ans.Mutability in Python refers to whether an object‚Äôs value can be changed after it is created.\n","üîπ Mutable Objects ‚Äì Can be changed\n","Examples: list, dict, set\n"],"metadata":{"id":"GSIv9wxlRErI"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["My_list=[1,2, 3]\n","My_list[0]=10"],"metadata":{"id":"gKTEZQscVqk7"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["üîπ Immutable Objects ‚Äì Cannot be changed\n","Examples: int, float, str, tuple"],"metadata":{"id":"8KDjMCvrVkyC"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["My_str=\"hello\"\n","My_str[0]=H\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":158},"id":"EWy1hsUYWidG","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1751815840351,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1761,"user":{"displayName":"Disha Singh","userId":"15942053462058723570"}},"outputId":"7c8aa3e0-1b6b-42c0-d709-cd1ae5268498"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"NameError","evalue":"name 'H' is not defined","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m                                 Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m/tmp/ipython-input-2-1767357247.py\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<cell line: 0>\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      1\u001b[0m \u001b[0mMy_str\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"hello\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 2\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0mMy_str\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m[\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m0\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m]\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m\u001b[0mH\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m: name 'H' is not defined"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["6.Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","ans.Tuples and lists are the same in every way except two: tuples use parentheses instead of square brackets, and the items in tuples cannot be modified (but the items in lists can be modified).

They are essential for controlling program flow and making decisions based on multiple conditions.\n","There are three primary logical operators in Python:\n","->and operator:\n",".Returns True if both operands are True.\n",".Returns False if either operand is False.\n",".Example: (x > 5) and (y < 10) will be True only if x is greater than 5 AND y is less than 10.\n","->or operator:\n",".Returns True if at least one of the operands is True.\n",".Returns False only if both operands are False.\n",".Example: (age < 18) or (has_license) will be True if the age is less than 18 OR the person has a license (or both).\n","->not operator:\n",".A unary operator that reverses the Boolean value of its operand.\n",".If the operand is True, not returns False.\n",".If the operand is False, not returns True.\n","Example: not (is_empty) will be True if is_empty is False.\n","\n","9.What is type casting in Python?\n","ans.Type casting in Python, also known as type conversion, is the process of converting a value from one data type to another. This is often necessary when you need to perform operations that require specific data types, or when you need to store data in a different format.\n","\n","**There are two main types of type casting in Python:**\n","->Implicit Type Conversion (Coercion):\n","This occurs automatically when Python converts a data type to another without explicit user intervention. This typically happens in expressions where different data types are involved, and Python decides how to handle the conversion to avoid data loss or errors. For example, when an integer is added to a float, the integer is implicitly converted to a float to ensure the result is a float.\n","->Explicit Type Conversion (Type Casting):\n","This involves manually converting a data type using built-in functions or constructors. This allows you to explicitly control the conversion process and ensures that the data is converted to the desired type. Common functions used for explicit type casting include:\n",".int(): Converts to an integer.\n",".float(): Converts to a floating-point number.\n",".str(): Converts to a string.\n",".list(): Converts to a list.\n",".tuple(): Converts to a tuple.\n","\n","10.What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting\n","ans.Implicit and explicit type casting (also known as type conversion) differ in how they handle the conversion of data types. Implicit casting, also called automatic type conversion, is done automatically by the compiler when different data types are mixed in an expression. Explicit casting, or type casting, is performed manually by the programmer by explicitly specifying the desired data type.\n","\n","11.What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","ans.The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to enable decision-making within a program, allowing different blocks of code to execute based on whether specific conditions are met. This capability is fundamental for creating dynamic and responsive programs that can adapt to varying inputs, data, or scenarios.\n","\n","12.How does the elif statement work?\n","ans. if the first condition is false, it moves on to the next ‚Äúelif‚Äù statement to check if that condition is true.\n","üîπ How it works:\n",".Python checks the if condition first.\n",".If if is False, it checks each elif in order.\n",".The first True condition is executed.\n",".If none match, the else block (if present) runs.\n","\n","13.What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","ans.The main difference between for and while loops lies in their intended use cases: for loops are typically used when you know the number of iterations beforehand, while while loops are used when the number of iterations is determined by a condition.\n","**For Loops:**\n",".Structure: for loops are designed to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or range) or a collection of items.\n",".Iterations: The number of iterations is usually predetermined or easily calculable based on the sequence being iterated over.\n","**While Loops:**\n",".Structure: while loops execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition remains true.\n",".Iterations: The number of iterations is not fixed and depends on whether the condition remains true. A while loop can execute zero or more times.\n","\n","14.Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","ans.In programming, for loops are best used when you know the number of iterations ahead of time, whereas a while loop is best used when you don't know the number of iterations in advance. Both methods can help you iterate through your code.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"4ZJsqvKcaCS1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Practical Questions**\n","\n","1.Write a Python program to
